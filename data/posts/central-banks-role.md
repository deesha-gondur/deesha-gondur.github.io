## Key Functions of Central Banks

Here are some of the main functions central banks perform:

- **Formulating monetary policy**
- **Ensuring financial stability**
- **Issuing currency**
- **Serving as banker to the government**
- **Managing foreign reserves**

### 1. Monetary Policy

Central banks control the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives like controlling inflation, managing employment levels, and fostering economic growth.

**Common tools include:**
1. Open market operations
2. Reserve requirements
3. Policy rates

```python
# Example: Calculating simple interest rate impact
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05  # 5%
time = 1  # 1 year

interest = principal * rate * time
print(f"Interest earned: ${interest}")
```

### 2. Financial Stability

They act as regulators and supervisors of the banking system, ensuring that financial institutions operate safely and soundly.

> — Financial Times

Central banks also serve as lenders of last resort during financial crises, providing liquidity to prevent systemic collapse.

### 3. Issuer of Currency

Central banks have the exclusive authority to issue and manage a country’s currency, ensuring its stability and integrity.

> The first central bank to issue banknotes was the Sveriges Riksbank in Sweden, established in 1668.

### 4. Banker to the Government

They manage government accounts, facilitate payments, and often handle the issuance and redemption of government debt.

**Government banking services include:**
- Managing treasury accounts
- Processing government payments
- Issuing government bonds

### 5. Managing Foreign Reserves

Central banks hold and manage foreign currency reserves, which help stabilize the national currency and facilitate international trade.
